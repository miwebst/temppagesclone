<h1 id="polly">Polly</h1>
<p>Today's cloud application, mobile, data-streaming, and IoT technologies all depend vitally on reliable connectivity. But underlying systems can fail, and networks are notoriously fickle: outages, latency, transient blips, spikes in load - all challenge 100% reliability.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/">Polly</a> helps you navigate the unreliable network. By providing resilience strategies in fluent-to-express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback, Polly can help you reduce fragility, and keep your systems and customers connected!</p>
<p>The closest project comparison is to <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki">Hystrix</a> in the java world. The .NET space has no comparable offering. We are building Polly to solve the same problems, but in a flexible, lightweight, ‘keep things simple’ spirit.</p>
<p>Best of all, that lightweight approach means Polly can work anywhere .NET can run. Whether you’re building an occasionally connected mobile application, or a heavy duty business intelligence service, simply drop in the Polly NuGet package and get started right away!</p>
