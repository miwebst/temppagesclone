<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/wpf">Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</a> is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications.
WPF supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout,
data binding and documents. WPF uses the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to provide a declarative model for application
programming.</p>
<p>WPF applications are based on a vector graphics architecture. This enables applications to look great on high DPI monitors, as they
can be infinitely scaled. WPF also includes a flexible hosting model, which makes it straightforward to host a video in a button,
for example. The visual designer provided in Visual Studio makes it easy to build WPF application, with drag-in-drop and/or direct
editing of XAML markup.</p>
